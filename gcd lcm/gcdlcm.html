        <h3>Fundamental Number Theory Calculations

            This calculator provides precise and efficient computation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) for a given set of numbers. The GCD and LCM are foundational concepts in number theory with applications spanning various mathematical disciplines. The GCD represents the largest integer that divides a given set of numbers without leaving a remainder, while the LCM denotes the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all numbers in the set. These calculations are indispensable in areas such as algebra, geometry, and cryptography.</h3>
