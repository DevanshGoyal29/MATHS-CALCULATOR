        <h3>Distance Between Two Points Calculator

            This tool calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. Given the coordinates (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) of two points, the calculator efficiently computes the straight-line distance between them using the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is fundamental in various fields, including geometry, physics, and computer science. Whether you're solving geometric problems, analyzing spatial data, or working on engineering applications, this distance calculator provides a precise and convenient solution.</h3>
