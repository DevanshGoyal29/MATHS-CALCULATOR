        <h3>Uncover the Building Blocks of Numbers!

            Every number can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers. This process is called prime factorization. Prime numbers are the fundamental building blocks of numbers, as they cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and themselves. Enter any positive integer, and this tool will break it down into its prime factors. Understanding prime factorization is essential for various mathematical concepts and problem-solving techniques.</h3>
