        <h3>Slope Calculator -

            This online tool efficiently calculates the slope of a line given two points in the Cartesian coordinate plane. The slope, often denoted as 'm', represents the steepness or inclination of a line and is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and geometry. By inputting the coordinates (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) of two distinct points on the line, the calculator accurately computes the slope using the formula:
            m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁).
            Understanding the slope is crucial for various mathematical and scientific applications, including linear equations, graphing, and analyzing linear relationships between variables. This tool provides a convenient and precise method for determining the slope of a line, aiding in problem-solving and data analysis.</h3>
