        <h3>Interest Rate Analysis Tool

            This tool provides accurate calculations for both simple and compound interest, essential for financial planning and analysis. Simple interest is computed based on the initial principal amount, while compound interest accounts for the compounding effect over time. By inputting the principal, interest rate, and time period, users can effectively compare the growth potential of investments or the cost of borrowing under different interest regimes. This tool empowers users to make informed financial decisions by quantifying the impact of interest rates on monetary values.
